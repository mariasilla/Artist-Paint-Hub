General Assembly Project 2 CRUD

Full stack CRUD app  where artists are able to create their own portfolio, view other users’ portfolios, upload or delete their paintings, update their account information and comment on paintings (currently in progress). The application pulls data from Meetup API to display art events happening in the user’s zip code area.
